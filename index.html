            <h2>So what is HTML?</h2></header>
            <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Anatomy of an HTML document</h3>
                <p>Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page.</p>
                <ul>Here, we have the following:
                    <li>
                        <code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code>
                        — the doctype. It is required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much, and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <code>&lthtml&gt&lt/html&gt</code>
                            — the &lthtml&gt element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <code>&lthead&gt&lt/head&gt</code>
                            — the &lthead&gt element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <code>&ltmeta charset="utf-8"&gt</code>
                            — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <code>&lttitle&gt&lt/title&gt</code>
                            — the &lttitle&gt element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <code>&ltbody&gt&lt/body&gt</code>
                            — the &ltbody&gt element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks or whatever else.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>So what is CSS, really?</h2></header>
            <p>Like HTML, CSS is not really a programming language. It is not a markup language either — it is a style sheet language. This means that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML documents.</p>
            <article>
                <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9461/css-declaration-small.png" alt="Anatomy of a CSS ruleset">
                <p>The whole structure is called a rule set (but often "rule" for short). Note also the names of the individual parts:</p>
                <h4>Selector</h4>
                <p>The HTML element name at the start of the rule set. It selects the element(s) to be styled (in this case, &ltp&gt elements). To style a different element, just change the selector.</p>
                <h4>Declaration</h4>
                <p>A single rule like color: red; specifying which of the element's properties you want to style.</p>
                <h4>Properties</h4>
                <p>Ways in which you can style a given HTML element. (In this case, color is a property of the &ltp&gt elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in your rule.</p>
                <h4>Property value</h4>
                <p>To the right of the property after the colon, we have the property value, which chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property (there are many color values besides red).</p>
                <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
                <li>
                        Each rule set (apart from the selector) must be wrapped in curly braces ({}).
                </li>
                <li>
                        Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its values.
                </li>
                <li>
                        Within each rule set, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one
                </li>

            <h2>So what is Javascript, really?</h2></header>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
            <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13502/cake.png" alt="what is Javascript">
            <li>
                HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
            </li>
            <li>
                CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
            </li>
            <article>
                <h3>What is JavaScript doing on your page?</h3>
                <p>Here we'll start actually looking at some code, and while doing so explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.</p>
                <p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in our How CSS works article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
                <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13504/execution.png" alt="img desc of js">
                <p>The JavaScript is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine, after the HTML and CSS have been assembled and put together into a web page. This ensures that the structure and style of the page are already in place by the time the JavaScript starts to run.</p>
                <p>This is a good thing, as a very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). If the JavaScript loaded and tried to run before the HTML and CSS were there to affect, then errors would occur.</p>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>So there you go, your first step into the world of JavaScript. We've begun with just theory, to start getting you used to why you'd use JavaScript and what kind of things you can do with it. Along the way, you saw a few code examples and learned how JavaScript fits in with the rest of the code on your website, amongst other things.</p>

                <p>JavaScript may seem a bit daunting right now, but don't worry — in this course, we will take you through it in simple steps that will make sense going forward. In the next article, we will plunge straight into the practical, getting you to jump straight in and build your own JavaScript examples.</p>

            <h2>Frameworks And Libraries</h2></header>
            <p>Taking into consideration the standpoint of the software development life cycle, the right choice among top front-end frameworks will be the fundamental step of your future success. The market has a wide diversity due to the vast set to challenges that developers solve every day.</p>
            <p>The proper front-end frameworks simplify and advance the development process at the same time. It should provide flexibility for further achievements whereas the customer receives excellent UX and UI. As for the development team, look for the framework that is comfortable to work with. Top front-end frameworks are always easy to maintain and test. Regular updates are must-have due to the rapidly changing demands of the market, new security threats, and versions of technologies.</p>

                <h3>React</h3>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*5IHLBz0HOmSxqMuKmqCYsA.png" alt="react">
                <p>React is the front-end framework created and developed by Facebook. The team was interested in obtaining high performance by building an effective UI. Jordan Walke proposed to create the library based on XHP and JavaScript combination in 2011. As a result, they received the library to build the web interface with JavaScript where the news update happens at the same time while customers use the chat. Facebook released the open source JavaScript tool in 2013. They continued the framework development and released React Native for Android and iOS in 2015.</p>
                <p>Firstly, it works with the virtual DOM and applies abstract copies of the real DOM. Therefore it updates all the changes of the user but has no effect on other parts of the interface. Secondly, this web front-end framework makes the updates rather fast, as React connects DOM to the user interface functionality. It has the special ability of the reusing the code components of every level with no changes of them. Thirdly, a stable code is provided by the one-direction data flow. Applying any updates, only the chosen components will be changed. Besides Facebook, such companies as Instagram and Netflix have adopted React, which optimized their web performance and the development efforts to increased efficiency.</p>
                <h4>React’s advantages</h4>
                <li>
                    Virtual DOM improves both the experience of the user and work of the developer — Virtual DOM helps to update any user’s changes without the other parts’ interference by applying isolated components. It greatly helps to smooth the experience of all participants in real time mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Saving time while re-using React components — React deals with isolated components, that’s why you can reuse them anytime you need. System upgrades will not impact or change your system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The stable code is provided by one-direction data flow — Direct work with each component requires one-direction data flow and makes the code really stable. Another thing is that only downward data binding is possible in this JavaScript framework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An open-source library with a variety of tools — All updates are released to the community. React has had the open-source library and engineers can introduce the additional tools.
                </li>
                <h4>React’s disadvantages</h4>
                <li>
                    Relatively long learning curve — It is unlikely to learn it in one day. It just requires a little bit more time to be aware of all the details than for example with Angular.Relatively long learning curve — It is unlikely to learn it in one day. It just requires a little bit more time to be aware of all the details than for example with Angular.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lack of documentation due to high pace development — The popularity of this web front-end framework is extremely higher than other ones. It has so many updates and innovations, that sometimes it is hard to find all detailed information.

                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*c1-gu8JmVnmlzH5hlG3n2w.png" alt="vue">
                <p>Vue.js is the web framework for building users interfaces. It is an independent tool that creates web interfaces and doesn’t require the additional extension. Vue.js was created by Evan You and initially released in February 2014. Probably you might not find the long list of big companies using Vue.js but it is definitely popular among developers and its popularity considerably increases.</p>
                <p>A lot of accessible features attract the developer to use it. Vue.js is easy to learn and integrate. Vue.js can be applied for both represented components and complete single-page applications. It includes component file layout and logical structure. This JavaScript framework deals with two-way reactive data-binding and doesn’t demand any extra libraries.</p>

                <h4>Vue.js’ advantages</h4>
                <li>
                    Clarity and simplicity — This front-end framework has the smallest API surface area. It is quite easy to start not only learning but using in a short time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Detailed and extensive documentation — You can find all the necessary documentation which is up-to-date and well-written. Also, there is always the community of developers who can share their knowledge with you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simple integration and code reusability — Due to its logical structure, the user interface developers have the ability to create flexible components and reuse them later, even in the other projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Browser devtools extensions — As mentioned above, Vue.js doesn’t demand any extra libraries, but it owns browser devtools extensions. Thus you can change separate components manually when it is needed.
                </li>
               
                <h4>Vue.js’ disadvantages</h4>
                <li>
                    Too much flexibility leads to the code irregularities — Some experts have brought up the point that a lot of flexibility is not too good. All web front-end engineers can contribute to its development, so it might cause certain irregularities
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smaller developers’ community — It is a relatively new and constantly improving framework. Vue.js is mostly supported by the individual developers but their user community fastly increases.

                <h3>Angular</h3>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/480/1*O6Q9ynjryVvJ1OHDZ2ukZw.png" alt="Angular">
                <p>Angular or Angular v2 or Angular 2+ is a complete rewrite of AngularJS by the same team in Google who developed the original front-end framework in 2010. It was released in September of 2016 as a completely new framework with new logic and features to address the challenges of web development as we know it today. Even the naming called a hot discussion in the development community, and it is needless to say that the complete absence of backward compatibility with AngularJS caused a huge controversy. Those who trusted Google and Angular community weren’t able to just upgrade their application to the new framework version to get all the new trendy dev tools and features. The app should be rewritten from scratch with Angular.</p>
                <p>Despite Angularjs users were left high and dry, this flop was addressed and all the versions of Angular ever since have the backward compatibility, which is very important for having it in our list of top front-end frameworks in 2019.</p>
                <p>Angular is an all-encompassing solution and is truly a framework instead of a just suite of libraries. Developers can focus more on accomplishing their tasks rather than looking for libraries and solutions for their tasks. This is definitely what makes Angular one of the top front-end frameworks now.</p>
                <p>Angular is created on in TypeScript which brings all of the advantages it provides: arrow functions, async/await, class syntax, etc. Introduction of well known OOP practices makes the transition much easier for shifters from languages like C# and Java.</p>
                <p>Created for the work in big teams, Angular leverages modules so each part of the team can work on their part of the code without being afraid to break anything in somebody else’s’ code. This also reduces the load for the work overlapping and QA.</p>
                <h4>Advantages of Angular</h4>
                <li>
                    Component-based architecture of Angular allows creating the UI with single parts (components) and reuse these components in the app. The elements also simplify user testing and maintenance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    TypeScript is the core language for Angular and it does compile to JavaScript, making the coding process easier for many engineers due to its improved navigation, and refactoring services.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    High Performance — the Angular Universal Support helps render the apps on a server, and Google has already created the set of tools for this particular purpose. High performance is also predetermined by the Google Long — Term Support (LTS) maintaining the Angular ecosystem and developing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Angular Material streamlines Material Design interface engineering — Angular team is constantly refreshing its framework with material design components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Large Ecosystem — well-known Angular Resources incorporates the UI environments, IDEs, analytics tools, facilities for ASP.NET, etc.
                </li>
               
                <h4>Disadvantages of Angular</h4>
                <li>
                    Transferring legacy systems from AngularJS to Angular — the difference between AngularJS and Angular is huge, thus it takes a lot of time and efforts to migrate the legacy systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Angular Complexity — despite the web-based structure, it is quite difficult to manage the components: e.g the devs need to have several files for one Angular component as well as maintain the elements’ lifecycle interfaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learning difficulty — the junior developers have to cover the bundle of things while learning Angular such as: components, modules, dependency injection, and many other things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The CLI documentation is poorly described and it does take a while for the developer to find out more about the CLI’s documentation on GitHub or other forums.
                </li>
